#### How to add an new application

Once create a site, users can choose the data sources they want to monitoring by adding different applications. For example, HdfsAuditLog application monitors the hdfs audit log. Currently, Eagle supports

* [HIVE Query Activity Monitoring](/docs/hive-query-activity-monitoring.html)
* [HBASE Data Activity Monitoring](/docs/hbase-data-activity-monitoring.html)
* [MapR FS Data Activity Monitoring](/docs/mapr-integration.html)
* [Hadoop JMX Metrics Monitoring](/docs/jmx-metric-monitoring.html)
